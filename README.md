# 🌌 Multiverse: A Personalized Android Login Experience

Welcome to **Multiverse**, a creative Android app built using **Kotlin** that lets users log in with unique credentials and enter a different identity — from *Richie Rich* to *The SNH*! This fun project explores **activity lifecycle**, **session handling**, and **dynamic UI customization** in a real-world setting.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Login by Identity**: Each password unlocks a different user profile and avatar.
- 🧠 **Remember Me Logic**: Uses `SharedPreferences` to remember login across sessions.
- 🎭 **Dynamic UI Personalization**: Titles like *Perman*, *Rich Boy*, *Mitsuo* appear based on login.
- 🌀 **Lifecycle Tracking**: Full implementation of `onCreate`, `onStart`, `onPause`, etc.
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: ScrollView layout adapts across screens using `WindowInsetsCompat`.

## ✨ Final Thoughts

This app was a **playful yet powerful learning experience** in native Android development. Building *Multiverse* helped me master fundamentals like lifecycle events and persistent state — and I'm excited to evolve it further!
